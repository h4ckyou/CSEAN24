We are given a binary and checking the file type & properties shows this

So this is a 64bit executable which is dynamically linked and stripped

Running it to get an overview of what it does shows this

From this we can tell that we need to provide the right flag and if we get it we should get a message that isn't "Wrong"

Using IDA we can decompile the binary and here's the main function

Uhhh it's a C++ binary ðŸ¤®

First:
- It prints out some words, then it receives our input using `std::cin` and stores it in variable `s`
- It then gets the length of the input string and stores it in variable `v10`
- Then it calls three functions passing the variable `s & v10` as argument
- It then iterates through the length variable `s` and compares `s[i]` against a dword value stored at `dword_4040[i]`
- If the comparism returns False it returns and print the error message "Wrong." else it prints the success message "Correct!"
